    "What key metrics help you trust results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sample size\n",
    "- Who/what was sampled? Are they relavant to the question?\n",
    "- How was the survey conducted\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Here is a brief description of how the test worked, to help you follow the rest of the lesson. The test consisted of three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Users were shown 12 photos in the first part.\n",
    "Users were shown another 12 photos in the second part.\n",
    "Users were shown 48 photos in the third part and asked if they saw each photo in the first part, the second part, or neither.\n",
    "After the test, users were given two scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"Recognition score\", calculated as the percentage of times they correctly identified whether they saw the face at all, regardless of which part the face was from.\n",
    "A \"Temporal memory score\", calculated as the percentage of recognized faces that were identified with the correct part (part 1 or part 2).\n",
    "Users were advised to take a 5 minute break between each part of the test.\n",
